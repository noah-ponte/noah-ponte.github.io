    <h1>Shutter Speed</h1>
    <h3>The length of time at which the media is exposed to light</h3>
    <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/515438768/photo/shutter-speed-dial.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=CIlef9TNz7omOPVWFGxewL76ncHAHgv8NUgZVQzpT40=">
    <p>Analogue cameras that utilize film have to keep that film unexposed to light until it is time to take an image</p>
    <p>Digital cameras utilize an image sensor to fast-track the process of film by taking and processing the image all at once</p>
    <p>A factor to consider with shutter speed is motion blur. This allows motion to be condensed into an image by capturing a length of time. An example from the home page is a car's headlights traveling along a highway. <br>
        With a long shutter speed we see the length of the car's travel and not just an instant by using a longer shutter speed.

    <p>Common shutter speeds are listed below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4000s: The fastest shutter speed on a digital Sony a6000 camera</li>
        <li>1/1000s: The fastest shutter speed on a 35mm analogue Canon AE-1 camera & on a large format Graflex Speed Graphic camera</li>
        <li>1/60s: Objectively the slowest shutter speed with minimal motion blur</li>
        <li>1/10s: The slowest shutter speed on a large format Graflex Speed Graphic camera</li>
        <li>2s: The slowest shutter speed on a 35mm analogue Canon AE-1 camera</li>
        <li>30s: The slowest shutter speed on a digital Sony a6000 camera</li>
        <li>Bulb: This shutter speed allows the user to control how long the media is exposed to light for. Some cameras require the shutter button to be held for the entire length</li>
    </ul>
